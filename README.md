## QandA me

Fullstack application that allows you to host a session to get asked questions by an audience, questions are asked, the higher upvoted questions are then pushed to the top of the list for the host to answer. Imagine Reddit AMA but live.

## Why?

After working at my university as a web develop, our marketing department were looking for a application that would allow freshers to ask their proffesors/ tutors questions about the university and upcoming year. The marketing department couldn't find anything suitable so I decided to task myself with build an app that would do just that.
